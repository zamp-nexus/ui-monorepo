/**
 * The rendered generative UI.
 *
 * `c1_response` is an opaque payload produced by Thesys from the governed
 * brief, so it is handed to `<C1Component>` rather than parsed here — the
 * whole point of the renderer is that this side does not know what shape the
 * answer took. `<C1Chat>` is deliberately not used: it would run its own
 * conversation loop against its own endpoint, and the conversation already
 * belongs to the Thread API.
 *
 * Interactivity is the part that needs care. A button in this payload was
 * written by a model, so whatever parameters it carries are untrusted. Only
 * the `action_id` is read, and only when it matches an action the *server*
 * put in the brief; everything else is dropped, and the server drops it again.
