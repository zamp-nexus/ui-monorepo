/**
 * The identity provider, replaced at build time for browser journeys.
 *
 * Aliased over `@open-zentra/foundation-auth` only when Vite runs in `e2e`
 * mode, so nothing here reaches a production bundle. That is why this is a
 * build-time alias rather than a third auth provider inside the library: a
 * provider would ship, and an auth bypass that ships is an auth bypass
 * somebody eventually reaches.
 *
 * It stubs exactly one thing — the browser's belief that a session exists —
 * and nothing beyond it. The token it hands out is a real RS256 token minted
 * by `tools/e2e/prepare.py`, which the API verifies against a real JWKS before
 * resolving a real Tenant under real RLS. Everything from the Authorization
 * header inward is the production path.
 *
 * The role is read from a cookie rather than baked in, so one build serves
 * every role and a journey changes only that.
