/**
 * Tailing the public Work Feed.
 *
 * The browser's own `EventSource` cannot set an `Authorization` header, and
 * this endpoint is bearer-protected, so the stream is read by hand: `fetch`
 * plus a reader over the response body. That also means the SSE framing is
 * ours to parse, which the parser below does literally rather than cleverly.
 *
 * The contract is snapshot-then-tail. The Thread snapshot hands over an
 * `event_cursor`; the stream resumes after it. A reconnect can replay an event
 * that already arrived, so events are deduplicated by `event_id` — the
 * sequence alone is not enough, because it is also the resume token.
