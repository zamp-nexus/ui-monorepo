"""Fan-out: the loop asking what else is worth measuring, and deciding by rule.

ADR-0026's Phase 3. The Board stops being a record of one measurement and
becomes the thing the analysis run reasons over: follow-ups run against it
concurrently, their Facts land beside the primary one, and a disagreement
between two of them is a Conflict nobody would have seen while each result
lived only inside its own Agent.

The acceptance rules are tested directly against `_accept` rather than through
a run, because they are the part that must not be model output.
