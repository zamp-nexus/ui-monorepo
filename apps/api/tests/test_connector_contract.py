"""The committed Connector contract and the application must not drift.

The frontend is built against `docs/05_APIs/connector-openapi.json`. If the
application changes and the document does not, the frontend is building against
a lie — and the failure surfaces as a confusing runtime error in a different
codebase, days later. This test turns that into a red build here.
