"""The ledger is metadata, including when something goes wrong.

ADR 0006 makes the audit ledger metadata-only, and #23 asks for a regression
test that rejects raw rows, prompts, Finding narrative, aggregate values,
credentials and hidden reasoning in *audit events and errors* — not only in
traces.

Errors are the interesting half. Every other field on an Audit Entry has a
shape that cannot hold prose: a UUID, a token count, a cost, a status from a
closed set. `errors` is a tuple of free strings, and the graph formats them as
`f"{type(error).__name__}: {error}"`, so an Insight refusal that names a claim
position and the governed metric it could not ground would travel into
ClickHouse verbatim and stay there — the ledger is immutable, so a leak here is
permanent and survives the evidence deletion that was supposed to erase it.
