"""The primary Phase 2 acceptance suite, at the authenticated API boundary.

One test per acceptance criterion on #24, and deliberately not stubs. The other
API tests substitute an `InvestigationServiceStub` because they are asking
narrow questions about the HTTP layer; this file asks whether the *product*
holds, so it composes the real application policy, real Postgres persistence
under RLS, and the real transactional outbox. Only the Agent pipeline and the
Semantic layer are doubled, because those are the parts that would otherwise
cost money and stop being deterministic.

A suite that stubbed the service would prove the stub. The publication policy,
the RLS predicates and the outbox ordering are precisely the things Phase 2
claims, so they have to be the things running.
