"""What a completed Investigation run established, before it becomes domain.

These three travelled with `InvestigationGraph` while LangGraph was the
mechanism (ADR-0023). They never depended on it — they are plain dataclasses —
and nothing inside the agent adapter reads them, so with the graph deleted they
belong beside their only consumer: the Orchestrator Loop that produces them and
the assembly that turns them into a `Finding`, a `DraftFinding`, and its
`EvidenceCitation`s.

Deliberately not domain objects. Assembling those is the application's job;
this module's job is to report what actually ran.
