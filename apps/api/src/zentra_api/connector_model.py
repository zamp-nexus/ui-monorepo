"""Reading a Data Connection's confirmed Join Graph as a Cube model.

This is the reimplementation of ADR-0014's governance intent — "only
permitted joins are queryable" — as compiled-schema absence rather than a
bespoke runtime gate: everything here reads only what `ConnectorService`
already exposes as confirmed, and nothing here can see a proposed or
rejected Relation.

`ConnectorService` has no production wiring yet (its four repository ports
have no adapter implementation anywhere in this repo) — this is a
pre-existing gap, unrelated to Cube, discovered while building this. Every
function here accepts `ConnectorService | None` and raises
`ConnectorNotConfiguredError` when it is absent, so a caller fails loudly
with a clear reason instead of an AttributeError deep in an unrelated
method.

`data_connection_id` here is deliberately the ADR-0012 vocabulary — Cube's
JWT claims and `Investigation.data_connection_id` use the same name — but
it is passed straight through as `ConnectorService`'s `data_source_id`.
The Connector domain has not yet split "Data Source" into distinct
uploaded/live-connection kinds, so today they are the same identifier;
this mapping will need revisiting if that split happens.
