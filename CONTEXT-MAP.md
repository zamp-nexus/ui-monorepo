# Context Map

## Contexts

- [ZentraOS Domain](./libs/domain/CONTEXT.md) — owns the product language shared by investigations, tenancy, semantic modeling, and trust
- [Investigation](./libs/domain/investigation/CONTEXT.md) — owns the lifecycle of a traceable attempt to answer one governed business question
- [Agent Execution](./libs/domain/agent-execution/CONTEXT.md) — owns autonomous analytical work and its typed outcomes
- [Connector](./libs/domain/connector/CONTEXT.md) — owns how ZentraOS learns what is in a Tenant's data and how that data connects
- [Data Source](./libs/domain/data-source/CONTEXT.md) — owns uploaded and live analytical inputs, versions, and Investigation bindings
- [Sequence](./libs/domain/sequence/CONTEXT.md) — owns the versioned graph of typed transform steps that turns a raw table into a final, model-ready table

> **Partially reconciled overlap.** Connector and Data Source still describe the
> same territory from two directions — Connector is implemented; Data Source is
> a Phase 3 plan with no code behind it yet — and still disagree on whether Data
> Source's own query-execution path (DuckDB, per the Phase 3 plan) versus Cube
> (ADR-0016) is authoritative. The **Relation** collision is resolved: Connector
> keeps Relation meaning an inferred join; Data Source's uploaded-file concept is
> renamed Dataset Table. Sequence resolves the transform-execution engine
> question for its own scope (chDB, not DuckDB) but does not resolve Data
> Source's separate query-execution debate.

## Relationships

- **Tenancy & Identity → every context**: every tenant-owned fact resolves to one internal Tenant.
- **Workspace Organization → Investigation**: Tenant-visible Groups contain Projects that organize Investigation Threads; they do not change authorization or analytical truth.
- **Investigation Thread → Investigation**: a Project-owned linear conversation preserves immutable messages while each resolved governed question remains a separate traceable Investigation.
- **Investigation → Agent Execution**: an Investigation delegates bounded work as Agent Executions.
- **Agent Execution → Investigation**: the Insight Agent proposes a Draft Finding from validated evidence; Investigation publication policy decides whether it becomes a Finding.
- **Agent Execution → Trust & Verification**: completed work supplies typed outcomes and evidence references for gating.
- **Trust & Verification → Investigation**: Human Approvals determine whether blocked work can continue.
- **Semantic Modeling → Investigation**: governed Semantic Metrics are the only business definitions analytical agents may query.
- **Connector → Agent Execution**: a confirmed Join Graph is the only set of joins an analytical agent may use over connector-sourced data. A discovered Source Field is not a Semantic Metric.
- **Trust & Verification → Connector**: confirming an inferred Relation is a governance decision in the same family as a Human Approval — it grants agents permission to act on something that could otherwise be wrong.
- **Data Source → Investigation**: each Investigation binds one eligible Workspace Snapshot or Data Connection plus exact model and policy versions.
- **Data Source → Semantic Modeling**: profiles and metadata may propose relationships and metrics; Tenant approval governs them.
- **Agent Execution → Data Source**: SQL Analyst proposes a Governed Query Plan; deterministic policy authorizes and executes it.
- **Connector → Sequence**: a Source Table may seed a Sequence's raw input; a Sequence never reads a Source Field the Connector has not harvested.
- **Data Source → Sequence**: a Dataset Table Version may seed a Sequence's raw input; the Dataset Workspace owns every Sequence built over its tables.
- **Sequence → Agent Execution**: the Data Steward Agent proposes and executes each Sequence Step as one Agent Execution; the graph, not any single execution, is the durable record.
- **Sequence → Semantic Modeling**: a Sequence's Final Table is the only thing the Semantic Modeler Agent may model; it never models a raw Source Table or Dataset Table directly.
- **Trust & Verification → Sequence**: Human Approval gates a Semantic Model draft built over a Sequence's Final Table; individual Sequence Steps execute without a gate because each is a typed, reversible, versioned operation.
