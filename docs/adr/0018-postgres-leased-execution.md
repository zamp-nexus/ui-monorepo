# Postgres leases own durable execution

## Decision

One Postgres queue owns analytical and visualization jobs. Workers claim with
`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, renew exclusive leases, recover expired leases, and
resume persisted checkpoints. Request handlers only commit work; they never run
it in request-bound background tasks.

For analytical jobs, "persisted checkpoints" meant LangGraph's checkpointer
when this was written. ADR-0026 removed it: the durable record of an
in-flight Investigation is now its `InvestigationBoard` and `WorkItem` rows.
Reloading them to resume a crashed run is not yet implemented — see that
ADR's Phase 2 status.

Cancellation is cooperative at provider boundaries. A queued job terminates in
the cancellation transaction; a running request is allowed to return before the
next checkpoint observes cancellation. Retries are bounded and create explicit
lineage rather than rewriting terminal attempts.

## Consequences

No Redis, Celery, Kafka, or second scheduler is introduced. Postgres is already
the transactional authority, so job and product state can commit atomically.
