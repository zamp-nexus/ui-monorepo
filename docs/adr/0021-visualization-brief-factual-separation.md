# Visualization briefs separate facts from rendering

## Decision

`VisualizationBriefV1` is a strict, bounded factual projection of a published
Finding: exact/display measurements, typed claims, citations, caveats, outcome,
confidence, supported view, and opaque actions. It has no representable SQL or
raw-row fields. Artifact identity couples publication version, normalized brief
hash, schema version, renderer kind, and pinned renderer/model configuration.

## Consequences

Generated action parameters have no authority. The server reauthorizes the
opaque mapping and permits only `open_citation` and `continue_conversation`.
Evidence erasure clears the brief, C1 output, and mappings; only an already-ready
artifact becomes a tombstone, while failures remain failures.
