# The Work Feed is a bounded public event log

## Decision

Thread events have a UUID identity and an atomically allocated decimal Thread
sequence. The discriminated public payload union cannot represent prompts,
reasoning, SQL, raw rows, credentials, or provider bodies. Postgres notification
is only a wake-up hint; persisted sequence is the delivery authority.

## Consequences

Clients snapshot, then tail after `event_cursor`. SSE sends backlog before live
events, accepts `Last-Event-ID` or `after`, emits 15-second heartbeat comments,
and may redeliver after reconnect; clients deduplicate by sequence or event UUID.
