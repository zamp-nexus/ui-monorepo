# Investigation Domain

An Investigation is one traceable attempt to answer a governed business
question. The context owns lifecycle, Finding, Evaluation Attempt, Validation
Result, terminal outcomes, Evidence References, and Human Approval transition
rules.

## Lifecycle

```text
pending → running → evaluating → awaiting_approval → completed
    └────────────── cancellation/failure/rejection terminal paths
```

Evaluation increments a bounded attempt counter. A retry after the third attempt
opens `contradiction_unresolved` approval; no fourth evaluation is allowed.
Terminal states cannot transition.

Validation is deterministic checks and issues, not a confidence score. Evidence
must use `artifact://`. Approval replay is idempotent only when the decision and
structured reason match.

Canonical language:
[Investigation context](../../libs/domain/investigation/CONTEXT.md). Behavior:
[domain model](../../libs/domain/investigation/src/zentra_domain_investigation/model.py).
