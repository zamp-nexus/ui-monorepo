# Agent Execution Domain

This context owns the contract for future autonomous analytical workers and one
bounded Agent Execution within an Investigation and Tenant.

The Agent Port declares structured input/output schemas, evidence, role-specific
Outcome Signal, tools, context budget, fallback, and evaluation-suite reference.
An outcome is either calibrated confidence or explicit validation; deterministic
work must not fabricate confidence.

Fourteen autonomous roles may eventually be registered. Auditor is a
deterministic event subscriber and Human Reviewer is a User at a Human Approval
gate; neither is an Agent.

## Current boundary

Three of the fourteen roles are implemented — Orchestrator, SQL Analyst, and
Evaluator — and participate in every Investigation. Each is a registry row that
the Orchestrator resolves at investigation start; a role with no enabled,
eval-passing Agent causes the Investigation to refuse rather than proceed.

Both the SQL Analyst and the Evaluator report `sample_size` alongside their
confidence — how many underlying records the figures rest on, read from a count
measure in their own result. Reading a count is extraction; scoring one's own
confidence is not, which is why the application bounds the latter by the former.

`IndependenceLevel` grades a recheck by what actually served each agent, not by
the routing table: `NONE` when one model served both, `PARTIAL` within a model
family, `FULL` across families. Fallback can collapse a chain onto one provider,
so the grade is taken from `usage.model` on what executed.

The governed catalog carries the permitted **values** of low-cardinality string
dimensions, not only member names. Without them an agent filtering
`North America` against data storing `NA` receives zero rows and no error.

The Semantic Layer Port is the only capability in the tree that reaches data.
No raw-SQL port exists for an Agent to be granted, which is what makes the SQL
Analyst's inability to see raw tables structural rather than instructed.

## Phase 2 boundary

Phase 2 adds the Insight Agent as the fourth implemented autonomous role. It is
separately registered and evaluated, produces a Draft Finding from validated
upstream evidence, and never guarantees a Root Cause Claim. The Orchestrator
continues to delegate and arbitrate but stops synthesizing Findings. The
Statistician remains deferred. See
[[adr/0011-complete-phase-2-as-insight-auditor-and-replay]].

### Write vocabulary and read compatibility

The canonical role value is `insight`. Phase 1 shipped `insight_root_cause`
before any implementation existed, and the name promised causality the evidence
cannot establish, so the two now sit on opposite sides of a read/write split:

- **Written** — three seams refuse the legacy value outright.
  `ck_agent_registry_role` rejects it on insert into `agent_registry`;
  `reject_legacy_role` rejects it in `PostgresExecutionRecorder.record`, before
  the transaction opens, because the role reaches the immutable Audit Entry
  from there; and `chain_for` has no provider chain under it, so nothing can be
  routed to run as it.
- **Not advertised** — `PostgresAgentRegistry.enabled_agents` filters legacy
  rows out. A surviving row is readable but must never be planned against: the
  Orchestrator persists the roles it is offered into the task ledger, which is
  a write the recorder's guard never sees.
- **Read** — `insight_root_cause` stays a deserializable `AgentRole`, so
  Investigations that recorded it remain readable and displayable in Replay.
  Migration `0005_canonical_insight_role` re-adds the constraint `NOT VALID`
  precisely so an existing legacy row survives the tightening.

This is the expand step. Removing the legacy read path is a separate decision
and is not part of Phase 2 completion.

### Registration gating

`agent_registry` decides which Agents may reach a Tenant, and
`ck_agent_registry_enabled_requires_passing_eval` means a row cannot be
`enabled` without `eval_status = 'passing'`. `nx run evals:promote` is the only
thing that sets it, so an Agent existing in the table is not the same as an
Agent being allowed to run.

Insight is registered by `0007_register_insight_agent` disabled and `pending`,
exactly as the Phase 1 agents were. Promotion refuses it in three distinct
situations, each of which demotes it to `failing` and `enabled = false`:

- **Absent** — no suite under `evals/insight`.
- **Incomplete** — the suite is missing a case named in `REQUIRED_CASES`. A
  suite stays green while someone deletes the case that hurt, so passing every
  case it happens to contain is a weaker claim than having been tested for what
  matters. Insight is the only Agent that declares required coverage; the
  Phase 1 agents predate the requirement.
- **Failing** — any case in the suite fails.

Insight's descriptor grants **no** tool permissions. It is the one Agent that
reaches no capability at all — it works only on state the SQL Analyst and
Evaluator already validated — which is what makes "did it invent this?" a
question with a decidable answer. Its fallback policy is the role-keyed
provider chain, attributed through `AgentOutput.fallbacks` and proved by the
suite's fallback-attribution case.

`nx run evals:check` runs the gate in CI. Before Phase 2 nothing did, so a
deleted suite or an unregistered Agent left the build green.
