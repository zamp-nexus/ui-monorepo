# Semantic Modeling

A Semantic Metric is a governed business measure with one agreed definition and
grain for a Tenant. It is not an ad hoc calculated field or raw-SQL metric.

Phase 1A's Cube model exposes gross revenue, net revenue, order count, average
order value, refund amount, refund rate, active customers, and repeat-purchase
rate over the synthetic commerce warehouse.

The deterministic Investigation consumes governed measures and dimensions
through Cube. The Finding retains comparisons and an `artifact://` reference,
not raw query rows.

Implementation detail: [[Cube Semantic Model]]. Canonical definition:
[ZentraOS domain context](../../libs/domain/CONTEXT.md).
