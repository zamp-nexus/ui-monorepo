# Investigation Trust Loop

## Trigger

An authorized User submits `eu_refund_spike`. The server fixes the canonical
question.

## Sequence

1. Resolve verified internal actor and Tenant.
2. Create `pending`, transition to `running`, and return. The request is not
   held open for the length of the pipeline.
3. The Orchestrator Loop opens an `InvestigationBoard` with the question as
   its seed Knowledge Gap, and drives each step below as a persisted
   `WorkItem` — see [[adr/0026-investigation-engine-owns-orchestration]]. It
   checks for a requested cancellation between Work Items, which is the only
   place a run can stop without abandoning an announced Agent Execution. The
   Orchestrator Agent plans first: it refuses the whole run if the registry
   has not promoted a required role, and proposes the follow-up measurements
   the question needs. The loop decides which proposals become Work Items by
   rule — never on the model's say-so.
4. The SQL Analyst builds one governed query, executes it, and reports the
   movement with a self-reported confidence and the number of underlying
   records the figures rest on.
5. The Evaluator builds its own query from the question alone, executes it
   independently, and compares. Its confidence is capped at the Analyst's, and
   it counts the sample independently rather than copying the figure.
6. A failed recheck returns to step 4 with the disagreement attached. The loop
   exits hard at three attempts whatever the score.
7. Each accepted follow-up runs concurrently as a child Work Item naming the
   measurement it came from, through steps 4-6 unchanged — a follow-up earns
   the same recheck the question does. Its Facts land on the same Board, where
   two measurements of one metric over one period that disagree open a
   Conflict. A Conflict is *documented*, never silently resolved: the loop has
   no evidence to say which was right, so the disagreement reaches the reader
   instead of one side being picked. A follow-up that fails leaves its
   Knowledge Gap open and does not cost the user the answer they asked for.
8. The Insight Agent — separately registered and evaluation-gated — turns
   the terminal result into a Draft Finding, preserving every Evaluator
   contradiction and reporting root cause unresolved. It runs once, after
   the loop settles, never on an attempt about to be retried.
9. Each Agent Execution is persisted and enqueued to the audit outbox as it
   completes, so an interrupted Investigation is replayable up to that point.
10. The confidence is bounded before it meets the Tenant threshold. A model may
    be less confident than the evidence supports, never more: the recorded score
    is the lowest of the model's own, a ceiling set by the smaller of the two
    sample counts, and a ceiling set by how independent the recheck actually was
    — `NONE` when one model served both agents, `PARTIAL` within a model family,
    `FULL` across families. `calibration_method` names whichever bound applied,
    so Replay shows why a number was lowered rather than only that it was. Sample
    counts diverging by more than 2x gate as a contradiction. See
    [[adr/0010-confidence-bounded-by-evidence]].
11. Transition to `evaluating`, then either `completed` when the bounded
    confidence clears the Tenant threshold and the recheck converged, or
    `awaiting_approval` with `low_confidence` or `contradiction_unresolved`.
12. Owner/admin approves to `completed` or rejects with structured reason to
    `rejected`. Exact decision replay is idempotent.
13. Publication atomically creates the strict Visualization Brief, opaque safe
    actions, pending artifact, visualization job, and public handoff. Renderer
    failure never changes the completed Investigation. See
    [[adr/0020-thesys-terminal-presentation]].

Result rows never enter the audit ledger or travel between Agents. They live in
`agent_executions.output` and are reachable only through the `artifact://`
pointer the ledger carries.

HTTP requests commit analytical jobs; Postgres-leased workers run and resume
them. Cancellation is checked before and after provider boundaries. Public
progress is projected to the resumable [[Visualization and Work Feed API]], not
to Thread messages or the audit ledger.

## Phase 2 change

The sequence above is current behavior. Phase 2 replaces step 8 with a
separately registered Insight Agent that produces a Draft Finding. Publication
then additionally requires complete, resolvable Evidence Citations. Replay
combines ClickHouse process truth with authorized evidence artifacts, and
deleted evidence resolves to Tombstones. See
[[Phase 2 - Insight Auditor and Replay]].
