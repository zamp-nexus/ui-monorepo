# Documentation Backlog

## Phase 1 — critical onboarding and architecture

- [x] Root MOCs, repository overview, product boundary, system context.
- [x] Investigation trust loop, local development, first-day guide.

## Phase 2 — domain and component depth

- [x] Current domain, component, API, data, and workflow notes.
- [ ] Split individual foundation-package notes only when active product use or
  ownership demands more depth.
- [ ] Reconcile and complete the existing
  [foundation architecture review plan](../foundation-architecture-review-plan.md)
  without treating its planned findings as current behavior.

## Phase 3 — operations and runbooks

- [x] Configuration, tests, infrastructure, readiness, and five initial
  runbooks.
- [ ] Add deployment/rollback and incident response after a production runtime
  is selected.

## Phase 4 — decision history and polish

- [x] ADR frontmatter/index, source catalog, templates, quality rules.
- [ ] Add verified owners after CODEOWNERS or ownership registry exists.

## Phase 5 — continuous maintenance

- [x] Automated metadata/link/source validation in CI.
- [ ] Add release records when a release strategy is accepted.
- [ ] Review critical notes monthly and all active notes quarterly.
- [ ] Promote durable findings from `.scratch/` investigations.
