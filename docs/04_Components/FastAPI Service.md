# FastAPI Service

The API is the backend composition root. It owns HTTP routing, request models,
authentication dependencies, CORS, lifecycle startup/shutdown, dependency
health checks, and adapter wiring.

`AppDependencies` constructs Postgres, ClickHouse, Cube, JWT verification,
Investigation service, and audit delivery from Settings. The lifespan starts the
outbox dispatcher and closes external clients.

The service exposes liveness/readiness, internal identity context, Investigation
create/read, Human Approval decisions, and tenant-scoped Group and Project
organization endpoints. It also exposes create-with-first-message, Draft
clarification, snapshot, archive/restore, and Draft-only Thread deletion
contracts. It also exposes Agent discovery, cancellation, immutable retry,
resumable SSE Work Feed, Visualization artifacts, renderer-only retry, and
reauthorized safe actions. Domain and application rules remain outside FastAPI. Organization
and Thread errors use stable codes while inaccessible resource identifiers
remain nondisclosing `404` responses.

Run with `npm exec -- nx serve api`; verify with the `api` lint/test/build
targets.

Failures: [[Diagnose Degraded Readiness]] and
[[Recover Audit Delivery Backlog]].
