# Repository Overview

This npm and uv workspace combines the Nexus product with reusable frontend
foundation packages. Nx owns project discovery, dependency analysis, task
orchestration, and caching across both languages.

## Product surfaces

- `apps/nexus`: React 19 and Vite Forensic Observatory.
- `apps/api`: FastAPI composition root and HTTP boundary.
- `libs/domain`: framework-independent Investigation and Agent Execution
  contracts.
- `libs/application/investigation`: deterministic trust-loop orchestration.
- `libs/adapters`: Postgres, ClickHouse, Cube, and telemetry implementations.
- `infra`: local service initialization, analytical seed, semantic model, and
  managed-service Terraform.

## Shared engineering surfaces

`libs/foundation` contains reusable TypeScript packages for authentication,
authorization, data access, browser persistence, synchronization, metrics,
HTTP, design system, and supporting utilities. `tools` contains Nx generators.
See [[TypeScript Foundation Library Catalog]].

## Toolchain

Node 24/npm and Python 3.13/uv are the declared runtimes. Vitest, Pytest,
Playwright, ESLint, Ruff, Import Linter, Alembic, Terraform, Docker Compose, and
GitHub Actions form the verification and infrastructure toolchain.
