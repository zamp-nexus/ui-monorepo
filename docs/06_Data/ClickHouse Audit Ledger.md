# ClickHouse Audit Ledger

`audit_entries` is the authoritative immutable Investigation Replay ledger. The
MergeTree order is `(tenant_id, investigation_id, created_at, entry_id)`.

The envelope includes trace/span IDs, tenant and Investigation, event type,
optional Agent/execution/step, timing, token/cost fields, input hash, typed
outcome, confidence when role-appropriate, tools/errors/model/status,
`artifact://` references, and redacted metadata.

Phase 1A deterministic events use validation outcomes and no confidence.
Application-generated event timestamps are monotonic so replay ordering
preserves causality even when transitions share a clock tick.

The runtime principal may insert/select only. Reads require internal tenant and
Investigation IDs. At-least-once delivery can create duplicate physical rows;
replay deduplicates stable `entry_id`.

Forbidden data includes prompts, raw analytical rows, uploaded values,
credentials, reviewer prose, and hidden reasoning.

## Phase 2 authority

ClickHouse remains authoritative for Replay chronology, participants, lifecycle
transitions, evaluation outcomes, publication decisions, and audit integrity.
It does not become an evidence store. Phase 2 resolves evidence content through
Tenant-authorized Evidence Citations from the artifact store; deleted evidence
resolves to a Tombstone while Audit Entries remain immutable.

## Split-authority Replay — current

Two authorities, and neither is asked to be the other.

**ClickHouse is authoritative for process truth**: chronology, participants,
Agent Execution outcomes, lifecycle transitions, evaluation results,
publication decisions, Human Approval, and audit integrity. Metadata only — no
raw row, prompt, credential or narrative reaches it, and the runtime's grants
are insert and select, so it cannot be rewritten even by mistake.

**The transactional artifact boundary is authoritative for evidence content**,
reached only through a Tenant-authorized Evidence Citation. Replay does not
copy evidence into the ledger to make it convenient; a reader follows a claim
to what backs it, and sees explicitly when that cannot be followed.

### Attribution

An Agent Execution's version was in `agent_id` all along and stripped for
readability, so Replay could not answer which build of an Agent produced a
Finding. It is shown. Safe usage — latency, spend, tokens — was written to the
ledger from the first Phase 1 execution and never read back, so Replay could
not answer "why was this slow?" at all.

### Two things the timeline used to lose

Reading only the ledger's own columns dropped a delivered event's failed
provider rungs, so an outage a fallback survived became invisible the moment
the event reached ClickHouse — the timeline showed *less* the longer you
waited. Both the delivered and the pending path now read `redacted_metadata`
through one reader, because a field that appears before delivery and vanishes
after is worse than one that never appeared.

Publication reasons travel the same way. A gate is explained at the point in
the timeline where it opened, in the policy's own vocabulary — the same words
the API and the approval panel use.

### Causal order

Delivered entries and undispatched outbox rows merge by `entry_id`, so
at-least-once delivery cannot duplicate a step, and sort by `created_at`.

The Investigation aggregate bumps `occurred_at` by a microsecond when two of
its own events share an instant, but `_investigation_from_row` rehydrates
`events=[]`, so that guard could never span requests: a denial and the approval
that followed it, written in the same microsecond by two requests, would sort
by a random identifier and Replay would show an order that never happened. The
floor is now read at the outbox — the one place every event passes through — so
each Investigation's timeline is strictly increasing regardless of how many
requests wrote it.
