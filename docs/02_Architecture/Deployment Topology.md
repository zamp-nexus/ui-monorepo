# Deployment Topology

## Local

Docker Compose starts control-plane Postgres, a separate warehouse Postgres,
ClickHouse, and Cube. The API may run on the host or through the optional
Compose `app` profile. The frontend runs through the Nx/Vite development server.

## Managed foundation

Terraform declares a Neon project in AWS US East and a ClickHouse Cloud service
in AWS US East. Managed credentials, state, and plans stay outside the
repository. Owner/migration and restricted runtime identities have different
privileges.

## Unknown production layer

No production application hosting resource, delivery pipeline, domain/routing
configuration, secret-manager integration, rollback strategy, or release
promotion workflow exists in the repository. This is an explicit unknown, not
an implied deployment design.
