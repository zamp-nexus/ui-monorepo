"""Signing keys and bound identities for the browser journeys.

The API verifies bearer tokens by fetching `{CLERK_ISSUER}/.well-known/jwks.json`
and checking an RS256 signature. Nothing in that path is Clerk-specific: point
the issuer at a local static server holding a key we generated, and the real
verifier, the real identity resolution, and the real RLS all run unchanged.
That is the point — the journeys are supposed to prove the authorization path,
so stubbing it out would remove the thing under test.

What this deliberately does *not* prove is Clerk's own login flow. That is a
third party's correctness, it needs their secrets in CI, and it would make the
suite fail when their status page is red. The seam is drawn at the token: we
assert everything from the token inward.

Four identities are bound rather than one, because half the acceptance criteria
are about what a role may *not* do, and a suite that only ever signs in as an
owner cannot show that.
