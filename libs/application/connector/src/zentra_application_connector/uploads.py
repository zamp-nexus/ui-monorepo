"""Turning an uploaded file into a Data Source.

Split from ``service.py``, which crossed the repository's 600-line limit once
every resource group landed in it. Uploads are the natural seam: they are the
only operations that hold state between two calls — a previewed file waits for a
commit — and the only ones that write customer data into Nexus storage.

Mixed into ``ConnectorService`` rather than standing alone, because an upload
*becomes* a Data Source and the two halves share the source repository, the
clock, and the permission rules. A separate collaborator would have needed all
three passed to it to do the same job.
