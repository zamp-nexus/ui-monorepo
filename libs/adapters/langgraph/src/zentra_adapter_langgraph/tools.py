"""The tools an Agent may be granted, and the registry that gates them.

Every tool here reaches data through `SemanticLayerPort` and nothing else.

still scoped to that tenant's own Data Connection through Cube, never

`AgentDescriptor.tool_permissions` is the gate. A tool outside a descriptor's
permissions is never offered to the model *and* is refused if named anyway,
