"""Nexus ClickHouse adapter.

Two distinct responsibilities that share a driver and nothing else. ``audit``
writes Nexus's own metadata-only ledger. ``source_connector`` and
``landing_zone`` read and write customer data for the Connector context, in a
separate database — keeping the ledger's guarantee that it holds no raw
customer values a property of where things live, not of care.
