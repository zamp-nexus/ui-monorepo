"""Reading a customer's ClickHouse as a Data Source.

Distinct from ``audit.py`` in this same package, which writes ZentraOS's own
metadata-only ledger. This module reads someone else's warehouse and must never
copy rows out of it: every statistic and every overlap measurement is computed
by aggregate query *at the source*, and only the aggregate comes back.

That constraint is the whole reason ``measure_overlap`` is written the way it
is. Pulling both key columns back and intersecting them in Python would be
simpler, would satisfy the port's type signature, and would quietly turn
discovery into data exfiltration.
