# Named `cube_analyst`, not the `sql_analyst` this migration originally
# seeded: `0001_phase0_foundation.py` creates every table via
# `metadata.create_all()` against the schema module's *current* definitions,
# so `agent_registry`'s role CHECK on a fresh database is always today's
# `CANONICAL_ROLES` — which no longer includes `sql_analyst` (ADR-0025) — not
# whatever the CHECK looked like the day this migration was written. Seeding
# the legacy name here would fail that CHECK on every from-scratch bootstrap.
