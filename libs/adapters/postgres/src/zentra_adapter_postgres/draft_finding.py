Its own module rather than another section of `analysis_run.py`, which is

Two tables, not a JSON blob on the AnalysisRun, because claim order and the
observed/interpretation split have to survive as *queryable structure* — the
publication policy will read them, and Replay has to render them. A blob would
have made both a parsing exercise.
