"""Erasing evidence, as an operation rather than a delete statement.

An Organization asking for their evidence to be erased is asking for something that
touches nine surfaces across four tables, must survive a crash halfway
through,
and must never report success while any of it remains. That is an operation
with a lifecycle, not a statement.

Nothing here is reachable by an Organization. This is the prefactor: the shape and the
guarantees land first, and the user-facing workflow that invokes them lands
separately. Building it the other way round means the first thing an Organization can
do is the thing that has never been exercised.

Two invariants carry most of the weight. A partial failure is never a success —
"we deleted some of it" is the one answer this must never give. And Audit
Entries are outside the boundary entirely: Replay must still prove the work
happened after its content is gone.
