"""Who decides whether a Draft Finding becomes a Finding.

Not the Insight Agent, and not the Orchestrator. ADR 0011 puts publication
authority in deterministic Analysis Run policy precisely so that no Agent —
however confident, however well-evidenced — can publish its own conclusion.

Four conditions, evaluated independently. A Draft Finding publishes
automatically only when all four pass; anything else opens a Human Approval
gate. They are separate rather than folded into one score because a reviewer
opening that gate needs to know *which* of them failed, and because a single
number cannot say "the recheck disagreed" and "nothing backs claim 2" at the
same time.

Every failure is recorded, not just the first. A reviewer told only that
confidence was low, when the evidence was also unreachable, would approve on a
false picture of what is wrong.
