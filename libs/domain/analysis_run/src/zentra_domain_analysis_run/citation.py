"""Evidence Citations: what a claim rests on, said in full.

An `artifact://execution/{id}` pointer says *where* the evidence lives and
nothing about what it is. A reader following one learns only that some agent
execution happened. ADR 0011 makes the Citation the user-facing contract
instead: the governed Semantic Metric, the filters, periods and grain that
scoped it, the Agent Execution that produced it, the validated aggregate, and
the Evaluator's verdict on it.

A Citation is never built from Insight's output. It is assembled from the state
the Cube Analyst and Evaluator already validated, which is what makes it
evidence rather than a second account of the same claim.

Citations are shared, not owned. Two claims about July's refunds rest on the
same measurement, and duplicating it would let the two drift. Order belongs to
the claim (`Claim.citation_ids`), not to the citation.
