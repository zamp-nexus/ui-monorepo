"""The Draft Finding — what the Insight Agent proposes, before anything decides.

A Phase 1 `Finding` is narrative: a headline, a summary, and a bag of opaque
`artifact://` strings. Whether a sentence was measured or inferred, whether a
contradiction was still open, and whether causality was established at all were
all buried in prose that only a person could read.

Phase 2 needs those as data, because Replay has to *render* them and the
publication policy has to *decide* on them. Everything here exists to make one
of those two possible; nothing here decides whether a draft publishes. That is
the Investigation's deterministic policy, deliberately elsewhere.
