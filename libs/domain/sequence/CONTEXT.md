# Sequence

Sequence owns the versioned graph of typed transform steps that turns a Tenant's raw table into a final, model-ready table, and the two Agents — Data Steward and Semantic Modeler — that build and hand off that graph.

## Language

**Sequence**:
A Dataset Workspace-owned, reusable graph of Sequence Steps that starts from one Raw Table and produces one or more Final Tables. Many Chat Sessions may reference the same Sequence's Final Tables.
_Avoid_: Pipeline, workflow, ETL job

**Dataset Workspace**:
The Tenant-scoped collection a Sequence belongs to. Data Source (Phase 3, not yet built) will own this as a persisted entity; until then its id is derived deterministically from the Tenant's own id (one Dataset Workspace per Tenant), so the Sequence page can list "this workspace's Sequences" without a schema dependency on a context that does not exist yet. Swap the derivation for a real foreign key once Data Source lands — nothing else about Sequence needs to change.
_Avoid_: Project, workspace (bare)

**Raw Table**:
The unmodified input to a Sequence — either a Connector Source Table or a Data Source Dataset Table Version. A Sequence never mutates its Raw Table.
_Avoid_: Source, input file

**Sequence Step**:
One node in a Sequence's graph: a single typed operation from the transform catalog (e.g. drop_nulls, cast_type, dedupe, filter_rows, rename_column) applied to its parent step's output, producing a new immutable Prepared Table.
_Avoid_: Transform, node, task

**Prepared Table**:
The immutable, versioned tabular output of one Sequence Step. Every Sequence Step produces exactly one Prepared Table; nothing overwrites a Prepared Table once produced.
_Avoid_: Cleaned data, intermediate table

**Final Table**:
A Prepared Table explicitly marked as a Sequence's terminal output — the only Prepared Table the Semantic Modeler Agent may model. A Sequence may have more than one Final Table.
_Avoid_: Output table, result

**Sequence Run**:
One execution of a single Sequence Step against chDB, recorded as an Agent Execution with its Outcome Signal, input Prepared Table (or Raw Table), and resulting Prepared Table.
_Avoid_: Job run, execution log

**Data Steward Agent**:
A registered Agent that builds a Sequence incrementally: proposes and executes one Sequence Step at a time from a typed operation catalog, in response to conversation in the Sequence's Chat Session, never accepting agent-authored SQL or code as a transform.
_Avoid_: ETL agent, cleaning bot, prep agent

**Semantic Modeler Agent**:
A registered Agent that proposes measures, dimensions, and joins over a Sequence's Final Table as a Metric Draft, gated by Human Approval before entering the approved Semantic Model.
_Avoid_: Modeling agent, schema agent

## Relationship to other contexts

A Sequence's Raw Table comes from [Connector](../connector/CONTEXT.md) (a Source Table) or [Data Source](../data-source/CONTEXT.md) (a Dataset Table Version) — Sequence does not define a third way to land data.

The Data Steward Agent and Semantic Modeler Agent are [Agent Execution](../agent-execution/CONTEXT.md) Agents; each Sequence Step the Data Steward runs is one Agent Execution, but the Sequence graph itself outlives any single execution.

A Final Table is the only thing the Semantic Modeler Agent may turn into a [Semantic Metric](../CONTEXT.md); it never models a Raw Table or an intermediate Prepared Table directly. The resulting Metric Draft follows the same Human Approval path as any other Semantic Model change — Sequence adds no second approval mechanism.

The chat that builds a Sequence is an ordinary [Chat Session](../investigation/CONTEXT.md) scoped to that Sequence rather than to a governed question; a Sequence started automatically mid-Analysis-Run is the same object as one started from the Sequence page, not a separate draft kind.

The Sequence page (a frontend React Flow canvas plus its read/create API) renders a Sequence's graph purely from this persisted state — it introduces no client-side state that could drift from what actually happened, and computes its own node layout rather than persisting coordinates. See `docs/05_APIs/Sequence API.md` and `docs/adr/0023-sequence-graph-layout-is-a-client-concern.md`.
