"""Deciding which field pairs are worth measuring, and what the result means.

Split into two steps on purpose. Generating candidates is free and happens over
every pair; *measuring* one costs a query against someone's warehouse. So the
cheap signals gate the expensive one rather than running alongside it, and the
query budget is spent on pairs that already look plausible.

No model calls are involved anywhere here. Inference is deterministic, which is
what allows accuracy to be measured against TPC-H's documented foreign keys
rather than asserted.
