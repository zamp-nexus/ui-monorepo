"""Which harvested tables and fields the agent system may see.

Every table and field a Harvest Run finds is visible to agents by default —
that default lives here as an absence, not a row. A ``CatalogAccessOverride``
only ever records a *departure* from that default, one Organization decision
at a time.

Pinned to ``table_name``/``field_name`` rather than to a Catalog Version or a
field id, for the same reason a ``Relation`` is pinned to a ``FieldIdentity``:
both change on every re-harvest, and the point of turning a column off is that
it stays off the next time the same table is harvested.
