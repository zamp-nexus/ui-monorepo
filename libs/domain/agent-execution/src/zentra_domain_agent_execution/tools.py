"""What an Agent may call, and what comes back when it does.

Agents made a fixed sequence of model calls before this: plan, then interpret.
That is enough to answer a question whose shape is known in advance, and it is
not enough to explore an organization's own catalog — where the right query is
not knowable until you have looked at what the organization actually has.

A Tool is the unit of that exploration. `ToolScope` and
`AgentDescriptor.tool_permissions` already existed and are the enforcement
point: a tool outside a descriptor's permissions is never offered to the model
*and* is refused if named anyway. That is what keeps ADR-0003's guarantee
structural once agents can act — the Cube Analyst gains iteration, not reach.
